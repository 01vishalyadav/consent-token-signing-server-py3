## Consent-token signing server

Consent-token is a feature supported in IOS-XR to provide an extra layer of protection before running certain privileged operations. The operations controlled by consent-token can be run
only if the challenge generated by consent-token is signed by the authorized keys.

The ct_sim.py in this repo is a reference implementation of the Consent-token signing server. The Consent-token signing server can be used to sign challenge string generated from the IOS-XR box.


To sign the challenge requests, the script should be used as below:

ct_sim.py -p <ct-priv-key-file> -C <challenge-string>

ct-priv-key-file should be the private key corresponding to the public key added to the box using the key-package CLI's.
